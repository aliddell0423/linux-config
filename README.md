# arch-linux-config
These are my config files and my package list for my arch linux system. 
You can start by installing the packages in the package list.
If you are using systemd as your init system, make sure you know how to enable the xorg display server and wpa supplicant on your machine.
Within the suckless folder are my comfigurations for suckless software. Install them to use my minimal dwm setup.
